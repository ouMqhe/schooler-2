## E5.3 Circles, Arcs and Sectors

### Circumference and Area of a Circle

These formulas are provided in your exam's formula sheet. You must know how to apply them.

*   **Circumference (Perimeter):** $C = 2\pi r$ or $C = \pi d$
    where $r$ is the radius and $d$ is the diameter.
*   **Area:** $A = \pi r^2$

Answers are often required **in terms of $\pi$**, meaning you should not multiply by $\pi$'s numerical value in your final answer. For example, if $r = 5$, the area is $A = \pi \times 5^2 = 25\pi$.

### Arc Length and Sector Area

A **sector** is a fraction of a circle, like a slice of pizza. It is defined by its angle $\theta$ at the center. An **arc** is the curved part of the sector's circumference.

*Visual aid: CircleSectorDiagram*

To find the arc length and sector area, we find the fraction of the full circle that the sector represents. This fraction is $\frac{\theta}{360}$, where $\theta$ is the angle of the sector in degrees.

*   **Arc Length:** $l = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi d$
*   **Sector Area:** $A = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2$

**Example:** Find the arc length of a sector with a radius of 9 cm and an angle of $40\degree$. Leave your answer in terms of $\pi$.
$$ l = \frac{40}{360} \times 2 \times \pi \times 9 $$
$$ l = \frac{1}{9} \times 18\pi $$
$$ l = 2\pi \text{ cm} $$

**Major vs. Minor Sectors:** The smaller sector is the **minor sector**. The larger one, making up the rest of the circle, is the **major sector**. To find the major sector's area, calculate the minor sector's area and subtract it from the total area of the circle ($\pi r^2$).

## E5.4 Surface Area and Volume

The following formulas are provided in your exam's formula sheet.

### Prism

A **prism** is any solid with a **uniform cross-section** (the same shape all along its length). This includes cuboids and cylinders.

*   **Volume:** $V = \text{area of cross-section} \times \text{length}$
    This is the most important formula for a prism.

### Cuboid

A cuboid is a prism with a rectangular cross-section.

*   **Volume:** $V = l \times w \times h$ (this follows $V = \text{area of rectangle} \times \text{length}$)
*   **Surface Area:** $SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$
    *Find the area of all 6 faces and add them together.*

### Cylinder

A cylinder is a prism with a circular cross-section.

*   **Volume:** $V = \pi r^2 h$ (this is $V = \text{area of circle} \times \text{height}$)
*   **Surface Area:** $SA = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh$
    The formula sheet gives the **Curved Surface Area**: $CSA = 2\pi rh$. The total surface area adds the areas of the two circular ends.

### Sphere

*   **Volume:** $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
*   **Surface Area:** $SA = 4\pi r^2$

### Pyramid

*   **Volume:** $V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{area of base} \times h$
    The base can be any shape (square, rectangular, triangular). $h$ is the perpendicular height.

### Cone

*   **Volume:** $V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$
*   **Curved Surface Area:** $CSA = \pi r l$
    where $l$ is the slant height. The total surface area adds the area of the circular base: $SA = \pi r l + \pi r^2$.

**General Problem-Solving Tips:**

3.  Choose the correct formula from the list you are given.
4.  Substitute the values into the formula.
5.  Calculate, leaving your answer in terms of $\pi$ if requested.
6.  Always include the correct units (e.g., cm³, m²).
