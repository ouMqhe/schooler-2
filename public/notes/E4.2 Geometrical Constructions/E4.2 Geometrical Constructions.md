# E4.2 Geometrical Constructions

## 1. Measure and Draw Lines and Angles

- Use a ruler for all straight edges
- Measure lines accurately using appropriate units (cm, mm)
- Measure angles using a protractor
- Draw angles to specified degrees

## 2. Construct a Triangle Given Three Side Lengths

### Steps for Triangle Construction:
1. Draw one side of the triangle to given length
2. Set compass to length of second side
3. Draw arc from one endpoint of first side
4. Set compass to length of third side
5. Draw arc from other endpoint of first side
6. Intersection point of arcs is the third vertex
7. Join vertices to complete triangle

**Construction arcs must be shown** - these are the arcs drawn with compass that help locate points

**Example**: Construct triangle with sides 5cm, 6cm, 7cm

## 3. Draw, Use, and Interpret Nets

### Nets of 3D Shapes:
- **Cube**: 6 squares arranged in cross shape
- **Cuboid**: 6 rectangles (pairs of equal rectangles)
- **Prism**: Two identical polygons + rectangles
- **Pyramid**: Base polygon + triangles meeting at apex

### Using Nets:
- Calculate surface area by finding area of each face
- Calculate volume from net measurements
- Understand how 2D net folds into 3D shape

**Example**: Draw net of a cube and calculate its surface area if side = 4cm

## Constructing a Rhombus

To construct a rhombus by drawing two triangles:
1. Construct one triangle using given side lengths
2. Use the same side lengths to construct the second triangle attached to the first
3. Construction arcs must be visible

# E4.3 Scale Drawings

## 1. Draw and Interpret Scale Drawings

### Scale Notation:
- 1:100 (1 unit on drawing = 100 units in reality)
- 1cm:1m (1cm on drawing = 1m in reality)

### Steps for Scale Drawings:
1. Determine appropriate scale
2. Convert real measurements to drawing measurements
3. Draw using accurate measurements
4. Use ruler for all straight edges

**Example**: Draw a room 6m × 4m using scale 1:50

**Graph Reference**: scale_drawing_example

## 2. Use and Interpret Three-Figure Bearings

### Bearing Rules:
- Measured clockwise from North (000° to 360°)
- Always written with three figures (e.g., 045°, not 45°)
- North = 000°, East = 090°, South = 180°, West = 270°

### Key Terms:
- **Due north**: Exactly 000°
- **Due east**: Exactly 090°
- **Due south**: Exactly 180°
- **Due west**: Exactly 270°

### Finding Bearings:
**Example**: If bearing of B from A is 025°, find bearing of A from B
- Bearing of A from B = 025° + 180° = 205° (if no obstacles)
- Add 180° for reverse bearing

**Example**: Point D is due east of point C → bearing of D from C is 090°

## Important Notes

- **Ruler must be used** for all straight edges in constructions
- **Construction arcs must be shown** - they are part of the method
- Perpendicular bisectors and angle bisectors are **not required**
- Understand compass directions: N, E, S, W, NE, SE, SW, NW
- Scale drawings maintain proportions but reduce size
- Bearings are always measured from north, clockwise
- Reverse bearing = original bearing ± 180° (adjust to stay within 0-360°)

These skills are essential for technical drawing, navigation, and solving real-world geometry problems.
