# Number Theory Essentials

## Core Number Types

**Natural Numbers**: Counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)  
**Integers**: Whole numbers including negatives and zero (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)

**Prime Numbers**: Divisible only by 1 and itself (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)  
**Square Numbers**: Result of integer squared ($4^2 = 16$, $5^2 = 25$)

**Cube Numbers**: Result of integer cubed ($2^3 = 8$, $3^3 = 27$)



## Factors & Multiples

**Common Factors**: Numbers that divide exactly into two or more numbers  
**Highest Common Factor (HCF)**: Largest common divisor  
Example: HCF of 18 and 24 is 6

**Common Multiples**: Numbers that are multiples of two or more numbers  
**Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)**: Smallest common multiple  
Example: LCM of 4 and 6 is 12

## Prime Factorization

Breaking numbers into prime factors using factor trees:

$$72 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 2^3 \times 3^2$$

## Rational vs. Irrational

**Rational Numbers**: Expressible as $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a,b$ are integers ($b \neq 0$)  
Includes: integers, terminating decimals ($0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$), repeating decimals ($0.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}$)

**Irrational Numbers**: Cannot be expressed as simple fractions  
Examples: $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, non-repeating non-terminating decimals

## Reciprocals

The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number:

- Reciprocal of $a$ is $\frac{1}{a}$ ($a \neq 0$)
- Reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $\frac{3}{2}$
- Product of number and reciprocal always equals 1: $a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1$

## Conversion Skills

**Number to Words**:  
6,000,000,000 = six billion  
10,007 = ten thousand and seven

**Words to Number**:  
"Seventy-two" = 72  
"Three and three quarters" = $3\frac{3}{4}$


**Key Practice**: Prime factorization, finding HCF/LCM, converting between number forms
