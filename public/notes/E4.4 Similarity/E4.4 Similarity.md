# E4.4 Similarity

## 1. Calculate Lengths of Similar Shapes

Similar shapes have the same shape but different sizes. All corresponding angles are equal, and corresponding sides are in proportion.

**Scale Factor**: The ratio of corresponding lengths in similar shapes.

If shape B is an enlargement of shape A with scale factor $ k $, then:
- Length in B = $ k \times $ Length in A

## 2. Relationships in Similar Shapes and Solids

### For Similar 2D Shapes:
- **Lengths**: Scale factor = $ k $
- **Areas**: Scale factor = $ k^2 $
  - Area of B = $ k^2 \times $ Area of A

### For Similar 3D Solids:
- **Lengths**: Scale factor = $ k $
- **Surface Areas**: Scale factor = $ k^2 $
  - Surface Area of B = $ k^2 \times $ Surface Area of A
- **Volumes**: Scale factor = $ k^3 $
  - Volume of B = $ k^3 \times $ Volume of A

**Formula**: 
$
\text{Volume of A} = \frac{(\text{Length of A})^3}{(\text{Length of B})^3} \times \text{Volume of B}
$

## 3. Solve Problems and Give Explanations Involving Similarity

### Proving Triangle Similarity:
Triangles can be proven similar using:
- **AA** (Angle-Angle): Two pairs of corresponding angles equal
- **SSS** (Side-Side-Side): Three pairs of corresponding sides in proportion
- **SAS** (Side-Angle-Side): Two pairs of sides in proportion and included angle equal

- Calculate areas and volumes of similar shapes
- Solve real-world problems involving enlargement/reduction

# E4.5 Symmetry

## 1. Line Symmetry and Rotational Symmetry in 2D

### Line Symmetry:
- A shape has line symmetry if it can be folded along a line so that both halves match exactly
- The line is called the **line of symmetry** or **axis of symmetry**

### Rotational Symmetry:
- A shape has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated about a point and look the same in other positions
- **Order of rotational symmetry**: Number of times the shape matches itself in a full rotation (360Â°)

## 2. Symmetry Properties of 3D Solids

### Prisms and Cylinders:
- **Planes of symmetry**: Multiple planes that cut the solid into mirror images
- **Axes of symmetry**: Lines about which the solid can be rotated to coincide with itself

### Pyramids and Cones:
- **Planes of symmetry**: Planes through the apex and center of the base
- **Axes of symmetry**: Vertical axis through apex and center of base

## Important Notes

- Similar shapes maintain the same angles and proportions
- Scale factor applies linearly to lengths, quadratically to areas, and cubically to volumes
- Symmetry properties help identify and classify shapes
- Understanding symmetry is crucial for solving geometry problems and proofs
- Regular polygons have the highest degree of symmetry for their number of sides
