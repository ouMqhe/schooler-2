# E1.13 Percentages

## 1. Calculating a Percentage of a Quantity

To find a percentage of a quantity:
- Convert percentage to decimal (divide by 100)
- Multiply by the quantity

**Example**: Find 15% of 240
- 15% = 15 ÷ 100 = 0.15
- 0.15 × 240 = 36

## 2. Expressing One Quantity as a Percentage of Another

To express A as a percentage of B:
- Divide A by B
- Multiply by 100

**Example**: Express 18 as a percentage of 45
- (18 ÷ 45) × 100 = 40%

## 3. Percentage Increase or Decrease

### Percentage Increase
$\text{Increase} = \text{Original} \times \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}$

$\text{New Amount} = \text{Original} \times (1 + \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100})$

### Percentage Decrease
$\text{Decrease} = \text{Original} \times \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}$

$\text{New Amount} = \text{Original} \times (1 - \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100})$

**Example**: Increase 80 by 15%
- Increase = 80 × 0.15 = 12
- New amount = 80 + 12 = 92
- Or: 80 × 1.15 = 92

## 4. Simple and Compound Interest

### Simple Interest
$\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}$

**Example**: $500 at 4% simple interest for 3 years
- Interest = 500 × 0.04 × 3 = $60
- Total = 500 + 60 = $560

### Compound Interest
$\text{Amount} = P(1 + \frac{r}{100})^n$
Where:
- P = principal
- r = rate per period
- n = number of periods

**Example**: $500 at 4% compound interest for 3 years
- Amount = 500 × (1.04)³
- = 500 × 1.124864 = $562.43

## 5. Reverse Percentages

Finding original value given final value and percentage change.

**Example**: After 20% discount, price is $96. Find original price.
- Discounted price = 80% of original (100% - 20%)
- Original = 96 ÷ 0.80 = $120

**Example**: Cost price given selling price $138 and 15% profit
- Selling price = 115% of cost price
- Cost price = 138 ÷ 1.15 = $120

# E1.14 Using a Calculator

## 1. Efficient Calculator Use
- Use memory functions for multi-step calculations
- Use brackets to ensure correct order of operations
- Know how to access secondary functions

## 2. Appropriate Value Entry
**Time examples**:
- 2 hours 30 minutes = 2.5 hours or 2° 30' 0"
- 3 hours 15 minutes = 3.25 hours

**Money examples**:
- 4.8 = $4.80
- 12.75 = $12.75

**Fraction examples**:
- ¾ = 0.75
- 2½ = 2.5

## 3. Interpreting Calculator Display
- Don't round intermediate values
- Only round final answer to required accuracy
- Understand when calculator shows fractions vs decimals
- Recognize recurring decimal notation (e.g., 0.333...)

**Example**: Calculate ⅔ of 45
- Enter 2 ÷ 3 × 45 = 30
- Don't round 0.6666667 to 0.67 before multiplying

## Key Points to Remember
- For percentage problems, identify whether you need to find percentage of, express as percentage, or reverse percentage
- With compound interest, amount grows exponentially
- Reverse percentages require dividing by the percentage multiplier
- Calculator entries must match the units required in the answer
- Always check if answer needs rounding in context

These skills are essential for financial calculations, data analysis, and real-world problem solving.
