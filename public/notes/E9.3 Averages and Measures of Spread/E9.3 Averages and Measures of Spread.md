## E9.3 Averages and Measures of Spread

### 1. Calculating Averages and Spread (Individual Data)

**Averages (Measures of Central Tendency)** tell us about the typical or central value in a dataset.

- **Mean:** The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
  $$ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}} $$
  *Use when:* Data has no extreme values and is roughly symmetrical.

- **Median:** The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order.
  - For an odd number of values, it's the central one.
  - For an even number of values, it's the mean of the two central values.
  *Use when:* Data is skewed or has extreme outliers (e.g., house prices, salaries).

- **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently.
  - A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode (bimodal, multimodal), or no mode.
  *Use when:* Dealing with categorical data or needing to know the most popular item.

**Measures of Spread (Variation)** tell us how spread out or consistent the data is.

- **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest value.
  $$ \text{Range} = \text{Maximum value} - \text{Minimum value} $$
  *Simple but easily distorted by extreme values.*

- **Quartiles:** Values that split the ordered data into four equal parts.
  - **Lower Quartile (Q1):** The median of the lower half of the data (25th percentile).
  - **Median (Q2):** The middle value (50th percentile).
  - **Upper Quartile (Q3):** The median of the upper half of the data (75th percentile).

- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The range of the middle 50% of the data.
  $$ \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 $$
  *A better measure of spread than the range because it is not affected by extreme values.*

**Example:** Find the median, Q1, Q3, and IQR for the data: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18
- Ordered data: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18
- Median (Q2): 10
- Lower half: 3, 5, 7, 8 → Q1 = (5+7)/2 = 6
- Upper half: 14, 15, 16, 18 → Q3 = (15+16)/2 = 15.5
- IQR = 15.5 - 6 = 9.5

### 2. Estimated Mean for Grouped Data

When data is grouped into classes, we don't know the exact values. We estimate the mean using the **midpoint** of each class.

**Steps:**
1.  Find the **midpoint** of each class interval. $ \text{Midpoint} = \frac{\text{Lower bound} + \text{Upper bound}}{2} $
2.  Multiply each midpoint by its frequency ($f \times x$).
3.  Sum the $f \times x$ column.
4.  Sum the frequency column.
5.  Estimated Mean = $ \frac{\sum (f \times x)}{\sum f} $

**Example:** Estimate the mean from the grouped data below.

| Time (min)  | Frequency (f) | Midpoint (x) |  f × x  |
| :---------- | :-----------: | :----------: | :-----: |
| 0 ≤ t < 10  |       5       |      5       |   25    |
| 10 ≤ t < 20 |       9       |      15      |   135   |
| 20 ≤ t < 30 |       6       |      25      |   150   |
| **Total**   |    **20**     |      –       | **310** |

$$ \text{Estimated Mean} = \frac{310}{20} = 15.5 \text{ minutes} $$

### 3. Modal Class

The **modal class** is the class interval with the **highest frequency**. It is the best we can do for the mode when data is grouped.

In the example above, the modal class is **10 ≤ t < 20 minutes** because it has the highest frequency (9).

## E9.4 Statistical Charts and Diagrams

### (a) Bar Charts

- Used for **categorical** or **discrete** data.
- The height (or length) of each bar represents the frequency.
- There are gaps between the bars to show the categories are separate.
- **Composite (Stacked) Bar Charts:** Bars are divided into sections to show the contribution of different sub-categories to the total.
- **Dual (Side-by-Side) Bar Charts:** Bars for different datasets are placed next to each other for easy comparison.

*Visual aid: BarChart*

### (b) Pie Charts

- Used to show **proportions** or percentages of a whole.
- The angle of each sector is calculated as: $ \text{Angle} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Total Frequency}} \times 360^\circ $
- All angles must add up to 360°.

*Visual aid: PieChart*

### (c) Pictograms

- Use pictures or symbols to represent the frequency.
- A **key** is essential to show what each symbol represents (e.g., = 10 people).
- Parts of symbols can be used for frequencies that are not whole numbers.

### (d) Stem-and-Leaf Diagrams

- A way to display **raw numerical data** while maintaining the individual values.
- The **stem** represents the first part of the number (e.g., the tens digit).
- The **leaves** represent the last digit (e.g., the units digit).
- Data must be **ordered** for clarity.
- A **key** is essential (e.g., 4 | 2 represents 42).

**Example:** Display the data: 12, 15, 21, 24, 24, 32, 35, 41, 43

Stem | Leaf
1 | 2 5
2 | 1 4 4
3 | 2 5
4 | 1 3
Key: 2 | 4 means 24

### (e) Simple Frequency Distributions

This refers to any table that shows the frequency of each value or class interval, such as the tally tables and grouped frequency tables described in E9.1.
