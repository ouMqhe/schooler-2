## E8.1 Introduction to Probability

Probability is the mathematics of chance. It measures how likely an event is to happen.

### 1. The Probability Scale

Probability is measured on a scale from 0 to 1.
- **0** represents an **impossible** event (something that will never happen).
- **1** represents a **certain** event (something that will definitely happen).
- All other probabilities lie between 0 and 1.

### 2. Probability Notation

We use specific notation to write probabilities concisely:
- $P(A)$ is the probability that event $A$ occurs.
- $P(A')$ is the probability that event $A$ does **not** occur. This is called the **complement** of $A$.

### 3. Calculating Probability (Single Event)

For a single event, if all outcomes are equally likely, the probability is:
$$ P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} $$

**Example:** What is the probability of rolling a 5 on a fair six-sided die?
- Successful outcomes: 1 (rolling a 5)
- Total outcomes: 6 (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)
$$ P(5) = \frac{1}{6} $$

**Example:** A bag contains 3 red marbles and 5 blue marbles. What is the probability of picking a red marble?
- Successful outcomes: 3 (red marbles)
- Total outcomes: 8 (3 red + 5 blue marbles)
$$ P(\text{Red}) = \frac{3}{8} $$

### 4. Probability of an Event Not Occurring

The probability that an event does **not** happen is 1 minus the probability that it does happen.
$$ P(A') = 1 - P(A) $$

This is a very important rule. The probabilities of all possible outcomes must add up to 1.
$$ P(A) + P(A') = 1 $$

**Example:** If the probability of rain tomorrow is $P(R) = 0.35$, what is the probability it does **not** rain?
$$ P(R') = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65 $$

**Probabilities can be expressed** as fractions, decimals, or percentages. The answer $0.65$ is equivalent to $\frac{13}{20}$ or $65\%$.

## E8.2 Relative and Expected Frequencies

### 1. Relative Frequency as an Estimate of Probability

Sometimes we don't know the theoretical probability of an event. We can **estimate** it by conducting an experiment or collecting data.

**Relative Frequency** is calculated as:
$$ \text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of times an event occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}} $$

The more times we repeat the experiment (the higher the number of trials), the more reliable this estimate becomes. This is known as the **Law of Large Numbers**.

**Example:** A spinner is spun 50 times. It lands on red 18 times. Estimate the probability of the spinner landing on red.
$$ \text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{18}{50} = 0.36 $$
So, we estimate $P(\text{Red}) \approx 0.36$.

**Key Terms:**
- **Fair:** A fair die, coin, or spinner is equally likely to land on any outcome.
- **Bias:** A biased die, coin, or spinner is more likely to land on some outcomes than others.
- **Random:** Each outcome has an equal chance of occurring, and one outcome does not affect the next.

### 2. Calculating Expected Frequencies

We can use a known probability to **predict** how often an event will happen in the future. This predicted number is called the **expected frequency**.

**Expected Frequency** is calculated as:
$$ \text{Expected Frequency} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Number of trials} $$

**Example 1:** The probability a toy is faulty is 0.02. In a batch of 5000 toys, how many would you expect to be faulty?
$$ \text{Expected Faulty Toys} = 0.02 \times 5000 = 100 $$

**Example 2:** The probability that a seed grows into a plant is $\frac{4}{5}$. If I plant 150 seeds, how many plants do I expect to grow?
$$ \text{Expected Plants} = \frac{4}{5} \times 150 = \frac{600}{5} = 120 $$

**Remember:** The expected frequency is a prediction, not a guarantee. The actual results will often be slightly different, but they should be close if the probability is accurate.
