# E4.1 Geometrical Terms

## 1. Use and Interpret Geometrical Terms

### Basic Elements
- **Point**: A location with no size, dimension, or shape
- **Vertex**: A point where two or more lines/edges meet (plural: vertices)
- **Line**: A straight one-dimensional figure with no thickness extending infinitely in both directions
- **Plane**: A flat two-dimensional surface extending infinitely in all directions

### Relationships
- **Parallel**: Lines in the same plane that never meet, always equidistant
- **Perpendicular**: Lines that meet at right angles (90°)
- **Perpendicular Bisector**: A line that divides another line segment into two equal parts at right angles
- **Bearing**: A direction measured in degrees from north, clockwise

### Angles
- **Right Angle**: Exactly 90°
- **Acute Angle**: Less than 90°
- **Obtuse Angle**: Between 90° and 180°
- **Reflex Angle**: Between 180° and 360°
- **Interior Angles**: Angles inside a polygon
- **Exterior Angles**: Angles formed outside a polygon when sides are extended

### Shape Relationships
- **Similar**: Same shape but different size (all angles equal, sides in proportion)
- **Congruent**: Same shape and same size (identical in all aspects)
- **Scale Factor**: The ratio by which a shape is enlarged or reduced

## 2. Vocabulary of Shapes

### Triangles
- **Equilateral**: All sides equal, all angles 60°
- **Isosceles**: Two sides equal, two angles equal
- **Scalene**: All sides different, all angles different
- **Right-angled**: Contains one 90° angle

### Special Quadrilaterals
- **Square**: All sides equal, all angles 90°
- **Rectangle**: Opposite sides equal, all angles 90°
- **Kite**: Two pairs of adjacent sides equal
- **Rhombus**: All sides equal, opposite angles equal
- **Parallelogram**: Opposite sides parallel and equal
- **Trapezium**: One pair of parallel sides

### Other Terms
- **Polygons**: Closed shapes with straight sides (triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc.)
- **Nets**: Two-dimensional patterns that can be folded to make three-dimensional solids
- **Solids**: Three-dimensional shapes (cubes, spheres, pyramids, etc.)

## Key Points to Remember

- Candidates are **not** expected to prove that two shapes are congruent
- Understanding these terms is essential for describing geometric properties
- Many problems involve identifying and applying these concepts
- Visual recognition of shapes and their properties is important
- Scale factor is used in similarity transformations
- Bearings are always measured from north, clockwise, using three digits (e.g., 045°)

These fundamental geometric terms provide the language needed to describe, analyze, and solve problems in geometry.
