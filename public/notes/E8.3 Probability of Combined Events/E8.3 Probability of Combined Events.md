## E8.3 Probability of Combined Events

To find the probability of two or more events happening, we need a structured way to list all possible outcomes. The main tools for this are sample space diagrams, Venn diagrams, and tree diagrams.

### Sample Space Diagrams

A sample space diagram is a grid that lists all possible outcomes of two events. This is useful when the events happen simultaneously (like rolling two dice).

**Example:** Find the probability of scoring a total of 7 when rolling two fair dice.

1.  **Create the grid:** List all outcomes. There are 6 Ã— 6 = 36 possible outcomes.

    |       | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     |
    | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
    | **1** | (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) | (1,4) | (1,5) | (1,6) |
    | **2** | (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) | (2,4) | (2,5) | (2,6) |
    | **3** | (3,1) | (3,2) | (3,3) | (3,4) | (3,5) | (3,6) |
    | **4** | (4,1) | (4,2) | (4,3) | (4,4) | (4,5) | (4,6) |
    | **5** | (5,1) | (5,2) | (5,3) | (5,4) | (5,5) | (5,6) |
    | **6** | (6,1) | (6,2) | (6,3) | (6,4) | (6,5) | (6,6) |

2.  **Circle successful outcomes:** The pairs that add up to 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). There are 6 of them.
3.  **Calculate the probability:**
    $$ P(\text{Total of 7}) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} $$

### Venn Diagrams

Venn diagrams use overlapping circles to show the relationship between different events. They are useful for visualizing combined probabilities.

**Notation:**
- $P(A \cap B)$ is the probability of **both A and B** happening (the intersection).
- $P(A \cup B)$ is the probability of **A or B or both** happening (the union).

*Visual aid: VennDiagram*

**Example:** In a class of 30 students, 18 play football, 15 play basketball, and 6 play both. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student plays neither sport?

1.  **Fill in the Venn diagram:**
    - Number who play both: 6
    - Number who play only football: 18 - 6 = 12
    - Number who play only basketball: 15 - 6 = 9
    - Number who play neither: 30 - (12 + 6 + 9) = 3

2.  **Calculate the probability:**
    $$ P(\text{Neither}) = \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{10} $$

### Tree Diagrams

Tree diagrams are essential for **sequential events** (events that happen one after the other), especially when the probability of the second event depends on the outcome of the first (e.g., picking items *without replacement*).

**Key Features:**
- **Branches** represent possible outcomes.
- **Probabilities** are written on the branches.
- **Outcomes** are written at the end of the branches.

**With vs. Without Replacement:**
- **With replacement:** The item is put back before the next pick. The probabilities for the second pick remain the same.
- **Without replacement:** The item is not put back. The total number of items changes, so the probabilities for the second pick are affected.

*Visual aid: TreeDiagram*

**Example:** A bag contains 4 blue and 6 red counters. Two counters are picked at random **without replacement**. Find the probability of picking two counters of the same colour.

1.  **Draw the first set of branches** (first pick):
    - $P(\text{Blue}) = \frac{4}{10}$
    - $P(\text{Red}) = \frac{6}{10}$

2.  **Draw the second set of branches** from each outcome (second pick, probabilities change because one counter is gone):
    - If first was Blue: Now 3 blue, 6 red remain. $P(\text{Blue}) = \frac{3}{9}$, $P(\text{Red}) = \frac{6}{9}$
    - If first was Red: Now 4 blue, 5 red remain. $P(\text{Blue}) = \frac{4}{9}$, $P(\text{Red}) = \frac{5}{9}$

3.  **Find the probability of each path** that gives two of the same colour:
    - Path 1: Blue then Blue: $P(BB) = \frac{4}{10} \times \frac{3}{9} = \frac{12}{90} = \frac{2}{15}$
    - Path 2: Red then Red: $P(RR) = \frac{6}{10} \times \frac{5}{9} = \frac{30}{90} = \frac{1}{3}$

4.  **Add the probabilities** of the successful paths:
    $$ P(\text{Same colour}) = P(BB) + P(RR) = \frac{2}{15} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{15} + \frac{5}{15} = \frac{7}{15} $$

## E8.4 Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is the probability of an event happening **given that another event has already occurred**.

**Notation:** $P(A|B)$ means "the probability of A **given** B". However, knowledge of this formal notation is **not required** for this syllabus. You just need to be able to calculate it using diagrams.

### Using Tree Diagrams for Conditional Probability

On a tree diagram, the probabilities on the *second set of branches* are all **conditional probabilities**. They show the probability of an event happening *given* the outcome of the first event.

In the previous example:
- The probability $\frac{3}{9}$ on the second branch is $P(\text{2nd is Blue} | \text{1st was Blue})$.
- The probability $\frac{5}{9}$ is $P(\text{2nd is Red} | \text{1st was Red})$.

### Using Venn Diagrams for Conditional Probability

You can also find conditional probabilities from a Venn diagram by effectively "zooming in" on the part of the diagram that represents the condition.

**Example:** Using the previous class example (18 football, 15 basketball, 6 both), what is the probability that a student plays basketball, **given that** they play football?

1.  **The condition is "plays football".** So, we only consider the 18 students in the football circle.
2.  **From these 18,** the number who also play basketball is 6.
3.  **Calculate the conditional probability:**
    $$ P(\text{Basketball} | \text{Football}) = \frac{6}{18} = \frac{1}{3} $$

The key is to use the numbers in the diagram to find the probability within the restricted group defined by the condition.
