## E9.6 Cumulative Frequency Diagrams

### 1. Cumulative Frequency Tables and Diagrams

**Cumulative frequency** is the running total of frequencies. It tells you how many values lie at or below a certain point in your data.

**How to create a cumulative frequency table:**
1.  Create a grouped frequency table.
2.  Add a "Cumulative Frequency" column.
3.  For each row, add the frequency of that class to the total of all previous frequencies.

**Example:** Times taken to complete a task (in minutes).

| Time (min)  | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
| :---------- | :-------: | :------------------: |
| 0 ≤ t < 10  |     5     |          5           |
| 10 ≤ t < 20 |     9     |      5 + 9 = 14      |
| 20 ≤ t < 30 |     6     |     14 + 6 = 20      |
| 30 ≤ t < 40 |     4     |     20 + 4 = 24      |
| 40 ≤ t < 50 |     1     |     24 + 1 = 25      |

**How to draw a cumulative frequency curve:**
1.  **Plot points:** Use the **upper class boundary** of each interval against its cumulative frequency.
   - For the class `10 ≤ t < 20`, the upper boundary is 20.
   - Plot the point (20, 14).
2.  **Mark points clearly,** for example with a cross (×).
3.  **Join the points** with a smooth curve. The curve should start at (0, 0) if applicable.

### 2. Estimating Median, Quartiles, and IQR

The cumulative frequency curve allows us to estimate values that split the data into parts.

**To find an estimate for a value (e.g., median, quartile):**
1.  Find the corresponding value on the cumulative frequency axis.
   - **Median (Q2):** $\frac{n}{2}$ (where $n$ is the total frequency)
   - **Lower Quartile (Q1):** $\frac{n}{4}$
   - **Upper Quartile (Q3):** $\frac{3n}{4}$
2.  Draw a horizontal line from this value on the cumulative frequency axis to the curve.
3.  Draw a vertical line down from this point to the data axis.
4.  Read off the value on the data axis. This is your estimate.

**Interquartile Range (IQR):**
$$ \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 $$

**Example:** For the table above ($n = 25$):
- Median position: $25 / 2 = 12.5$
- Q1 position: $25 / 4 = 6.25$
- Q3 position: $(3 \times 25) / 4 = 18.75$

Draw horizontal lines from these positions on the cumulative frequency axis to the curve and then down to the time axis to find the estimated median, Q1, and Q3.

**Percentiles:** The $p$th percentile is the value below which $p\%$ of the data falls. The process is the same: find $\frac{p}{100} \times n$ on the cumulative frequency axis and read across and down.

## E9.7 Histograms

### 1. Drawing and Interpreting Histograms

A histogram is used to represent **grouped continuous data**. Unlike a bar chart:
- There are **no gaps** between the bars (unless a class has zero frequency).
- The **area** of each bar represents the frequency, not the height.

Because class widths can vary, we must use **frequency density** on the vertical axis to ensure the area is proportional to the frequency.

### 2. Calculating with Frequency Density

**Frequency density** is defined as:
$$ \text{Frequency Density} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Class Width}} $$

**How to draw a histogram:**
1.  Check if any class intervals have different widths. If they do, you MUST use frequency density.
2.  Calculate the frequency density for each class.
   $$ \text{FD} = \frac{f}{w} $$
3.  Plot the class intervals on the x-axis.
4.  Plot the frequency density on the y-axis.
5.  Draw bars for each class. The **area** of the bar ($\text{width} \times \text{frequency density}$) equals the frequency.

**How to interpret a histogram:**
- To find the frequency of a class, calculate the **area** of its bar.
- The modal class is the one with the tallest bar (highest frequency density), but only if the class widths are equal. If widths differ, you must compare areas.

**Example:** Draw a histogram for the following data.

| Time (sec)  | Frequency | Class Width | Frequency Density |
| :---------- | :-------: | :---------: | :---------------: |
| 0 ≤ t < 20  |    15     |     20      |   15/20 = 0.75    |
| 20 ≤ t < 30 |    20     |     10      |    20/10 = 2.0    |
| 30 ≤ t < 40 |    25     |     10      |    25/10 = 2.5    |
| 40 ≤ t < 60 |    30     |     20      |    30/20 = 1.5    |

Notice:
- The class `20 ≤ t < 30` has a higher frequency density (2.0) than `40 ≤ t < 60` (1.5), even though its frequency is lower. This is because its class width is smaller.
- The area of the first bar is $20 \times 0.75 = 15$, which matches its frequency.
- The area of the second bar is $10 \times 2.0 = 20$, which matches its frequency.
