# E6: Pythagoras’ Theorem and Trigonometry

## E6.1 Pythagoras’ Theorem

Pythagoras' Theorem applies **only to right-angled triangles**. It defines the relationship between the lengths of the three sides.

**Theorem:** In any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

The formula is:
$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$
where $c$ is the length of the **hypotenuse**, and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the other two sides.

**Example:** Find the length of the hypotenuse in a triangle with the other two sides measuring 5 cm and 12 cm.
$$ c^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 $$
$$ c^2 = 25 + 144 $$
$$ c^2 = 169 $$
$$ c = \sqrt{169} $$
$$ c = 13 \text{ cm} $$

You can also use the theorem to find the length of a shorter side.
**Example:** Find the value of $x$.
$$ 10^2 = x^2 + 8^2 $$
$$ 100 = x^2 + 64 $$
$$ x^2 = 100 - 64 $$
$$ x^2 = 36 $$
$$ x = \sqrt{36} $$
$$ x = 6 \text{ cm} $$

## E6.2 Right-Angled Triangles

### 1. Trigonometric Ratios (SOH CAH TOA)

For an acute angle $\theta$ in a right-angled triangle, the three main trigonometric ratios are:

*   **Sine:** $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
*   **Cosine:** $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$
*   **Tangent:** $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$

**Remember SOH CAH TOA!** This is the key to choosing the correct ratio.

### 2. Solving Problems

You can use these ratios to:
*   Find an unknown side given one side and one angle.
*   Find an unknown angle given two sides.

**Finding a side:**
1.  Label the sides relative to the given angle (Opposite, Adjacent, Hypotenuse).
2.  Choose the ratio that involves your known side and your unknown side.
3.  Set up the equation.
4.  Solve for the unknown.

**Example:** Find the length of side $x$.
*   Relative to the $35\degree$ angle, the known side (8 cm) is the **Hypotenuse**.
*   The unknown side $x$ is **Adjacent** to the angle.
*   The ratio linking Adjacent and Hypotenuse is **Cosine**.
$$ \cos(35\degree) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{x}{8} $$
$$ x = 8 \times \cos(35\degree) $$
$$ x \approx 8 \times 0.8192 $$
$$ x \approx 6.6 \text{ cm (to 1 d.p.)} $$

**Finding an angle:**
1.  Label the sides relative to the angle you want to find.
2.  Choose the ratio from the two sides you know.
3.  Set up the equation.
4.  Use the inverse trigonometric function ($\sin^{-1}$, $\cos^{-1}$, $\tan^{-1}$) on your calculator to find the angle.

**Example:** Find angle $\theta$.
*   Relative to $\theta$, the known sides are **Opposite** (5 cm) and **Adjacent** (7 cm).
*   The ratio linking Opposite and Adjacent is **Tangent**.
$$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} = \frac{5}{7} $$
$$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{7}\right) $$
$$ \theta \approx 35.5\degree \text{ (to 1 d.p.)} $$

### 3. Shortest Distance to a Line

The **shortest distance from a point to a line** is always the length of the **perpendicular** from the point to the line. This creates a right-angled triangle, allowing you to use trigonometry or Pythagoras' Theorem to find this distance.

### 4. Angles of Elevation and Depression

These are angles measured from the horizontal.
*   **Angle of Elevation:** The angle upwards from the horizontal to an object.
*   **Angle of Depression:** The angle downwards from the horizontal to an object.

**Crucially, due to alternate angles, the angle of depression is equal to the angle of elevation from the lower point.** This allows you to model these problems as right-angled triangles.

**Notes:**
*   Always ensure your calculator is in **degree mode**.
*   Final answers for angles should be given in **degrees, correct to one decimal place**.
*   These concepts are often combined with **bearings** and real-world problems.
