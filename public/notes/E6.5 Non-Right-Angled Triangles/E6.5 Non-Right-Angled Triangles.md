## E6.5 Non-Right-Angled Triangles

For triangles that are not right-angled, we use two main rules and a new area formula. **These formulas are provided in your exam's formula sheet.**

### 1. The Sine Rule

The sine rule relates the sides of a triangle to the sines of their opposite angles. It is used when you know:
- Two angles and one side (AAS), or
- Two sides and a non-included angle (SSA - the ambiguous case).

The rule is:
$$ \frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} $$
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides, and $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the angles opposite those sides, respectively.

**Finding a side (AAS):**
$$ a = \frac{b \times \sin A}{\sin B} $$

**Finding an angle (SSA):**
$$ \sin A = \frac{a \times \sin B}{b} $$

**The Ambiguous Case (SSA):**
When you are given two sides and a non-included acute angle, sometimes two different triangles are possible. This happens if the given side opposite the given angle is shorter than the other given side but longer than the altitude of the potential triangle.
- If $\text{side} > h$ and $\text{side} < \text{other side}$, two triangles exist.
- If $\text{side} = h$, one right-angled triangle exists.
- If $\text{side} < h$, no triangle exists.
*(Where $h = \text{other side} \times \sin(\text{given angle})$)*

### 2. The Cosine Rule

The cosine rule is used to find:
- The third side when you know two sides and the included angle (SAS), or
- An angle when you know all three sides (SSS).

The rules are:
**For a side:**
$$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A $$
**For an angle:**
$$ \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} $$

**Example (SAS):** Find side $a$ given $b=8$, $c=10$, $A=60^\circ$.
$$ a^2 = 8^2 + 10^2 - (2 \times 8 \times 10 \times \cos 60^\circ) $$
$$ a^2 = 64 + 100 - (160 \times 0.5) $$
$$ a^2 = 164 - 80 $$
$$ a^2 = 84 $$
$$ a = \sqrt{84} = 2\sqrt{21} $$

### 3. Area of a Triangle

The formula for the area of a triangle using two sides and the included angle is:
$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C $$
This is especially useful for SAS configurations.

**Example:** Find the area of a triangle with sides 7 cm and 9 cm and an included angle of $30^\circ$.
$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 7 \times 9 \times \sin 30^\circ $$
$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 63 \times 0.5 $$
$$ \text{Area} = 15.75 \text{ cm}^2 $$

## E6.6 Pythagorasâ€™ Theorem and Trigonometry in 3D

Solving 3D problems involves identifying right-angled triangles within the 3D shape and applying Pythagoras' theorem and trigonometry to them.

### Strategy for 3D Problems:
1.  **Sketch:** Draw a clear diagram of the 3D object.
2.  **Identify Right-Angled Triangles:** Look for triangles that contain a right angle. You may need to add construction lines to create them.
3.  **Solve Step-by-Step:** Often, you will need to find a missing length in one right-angled triangle before you can use it in another to find the final answer (e.g., a diagonal across the base of a cuboid before finding the long 3D diagonal).

### Key Concept: Angle Between a Line and a Plane

The **angle between a line and a plane** is defined as the angle between the line and its **projection (shadow)** onto that plane.

**How to find it:**
1.  From the point where the line meets the plane, draw a line perpendicularly down to the line of projection. This creates a right-angled triangle.
2.  The angle between the original line and the plane ($\theta$) is the angle at the top of this triangle.
3.  Use trigonometry (usually $\sin$, $\cos$, or $\tan$) in this right-angled triangle to find $\theta$.

*Visual aid: AngleLinePlane*

**Example (3D Pythagoras):** Find the length of the space diagonal $AG$ in a cuboid of dimensions $5$ cm by $6$ cm by $7$ cm.
1.  First, find the diagonal $AC$ of the base rectangle using Pythagoras:
    $$ AC^2 = 5^2 + 6^2 = 25 + 36 = 61 $$
2.  Now, use triangle $ACG$ (which is right-angled at $C$) to find $AG$:
    $$ AG^2 = AC^2 + CG^2 = 61 + 7^2 = 61 + 49 = 110 $$
    $$ AG = \sqrt{110} \text{ cm} $$

**Example (Angle between line and plane):** A pyramid has a square base of side 4 cm and a vertical height of 6 cm. Find the angle between the slant edge and the base plane.
1.  The **projection** of the slant edge onto the base plane is the diagonal from the base corner to the center of the square.
2.  Length of this diagonal: $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{diagonal of base} = \frac{1}{2} \times (4\sqrt{2}) = 2\sqrt{2}$ cm.
3.  The vertical height is 6 cm. The angle $\theta$ between the slant edge and the base is in the right-angled triangle formed by the height, the projection, and the slant edge.
4.  We know the side opposite $\theta$ (height) and adjacent to $\theta$ (projection).
    $$ \tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} $$
    $$ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\right) $$
