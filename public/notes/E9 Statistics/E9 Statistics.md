## E9.1 Classifying and Tabulating Statistical Data

The first step in any statistical analysis is to organize raw data in a clear and meaningful way. This makes patterns easier to see and understand.

### Tally Tables

A tally table is a simple way to count how often each value or category appears in a data set (this is called the **frequency**).

**How to make a tally table:**
1.  List all possible categories or groups in one column.
2.  Go through the data and make a tally mark (`|`) for each occurrence next to its category.
3.  Every fifth tally mark is drawn diagonally across the previous four (`~~||||~~`) to make counting easier.
4.  Add up the tally marks and write the total frequency in a final column.

**Example:** A survey asked 20 people for their favourite colour. The raw data was: Red, Blue, Blue, Green, Red, Red, Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Yellow, Red, Blue, Green, Blue, Red, Blue.

| Colour | Tally | Frequency |
| :----- | :---- | :-------: |
| Red    | ~~    |           |
| Blue   | ~~    |           |
| Green  |       |           |
| Yellow |       |           |

### Two-Way Tables

A two-way table (or contingency table) is used to classify data based on **two different categories or variables**. It shows the relationship between them.

**Example:** A group of 50 people were surveyed on their preferred way to watch films (Streaming or Cinema) and their age group (Under 25, 25 and over).

|               | Under 25 | 25 and over | **Total** |
| :------------ | :------: | :---------: | :-------: |
| **Streaming** |    15    |     10      |  **25**   |
| **Cinema**    |    5     |     20      |  **25**   |
| **Total**     |  **20**  |   **30**    |  **50**   |

This table allows us to easily see:
- **Joint Frequencies:** The numbers in the inner cells (e.g., 15 people are under 25 *and* prefer streaming).
- **Marginal Totals:** The totals in the rightmost column and bottom row.

## E9.2 Interpreting Statistical Data

### 1. Reading and Interpreting Tables and Diagrams

You must be able to extract information from various data presentations, including:
- **Tables** (like those above)
- **Bar Charts** and **Pictograms** (for categorical data)
- **Pie Charts** (to show proportions)
- **Line Graphs** (to show trends over time)
- **Scatter Graphs** (to show the relationship between two variables)

**Key Skill:** **Drawing inferences** means making conclusions based on the data.
- **Example:** From the two-way table above, an inference could be: "A higher proportion of people aged 25 and over prefer going to the cinema compared to those under 25."

### 2. Comparing Sets of Data

To properly compare two or more data sets, you shouldn't just look at the average. You must also consider how spread out the data is.

**Measures of Average (Central Tendency):**
- **Mean:** The sum of all values divided by the number of values. (Useful when data has no extreme values).
- **Median:** The middle value when the data is ordered. (Good for skewed data or when there are extreme outliers).
- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value. (Useful for categorical data, e.g., the most popular shoe size).

**Measures of Spread (Variation):**
- **Range:** The difference between the highest and lowest value. (Simple but affected by extreme values).
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The range of the middle 50% of the data (Upper Quartile - Lower Quartile). (Better than range as it is not affected by extreme values).

**Comparison Example:**
Test scores for Class A and Class B.
- **Class A:** Mean = 65%, Range = 30%
- **Class B:** Mean = 65%, Range = 70%

**Inference:** While both classes have the same *average* score, Class B's scores are much more *spread out*. This suggests greater disparity in understanding within Class B compared to Class A, which is more consistent.

### 3. Restrictions on Conclusions

It is crucial to understand the **limitations** of data and avoid making conclusions that are not supported. Ask these questions:

1.  **Is the sample representative?** Was the data collected from a group that accurately reflects the whole population? (e.g., Surveying only students about a new pension scheme would not be representative of the whole country).
2.  **Is the sample size large enough?** Conclusions from a very small sample are not reliable.
3.  **Is there potential for bias?** Could the question wording, the time of day, or the location of the survey have influenced the results? (e.g., Asking "Do you agree our wonderful mayor is doing a good job?" is a biased question).
4.  **Correlation does not imply Causation.** Just because two things happen together does not mean one causes the other.
    - **Example:** Data might show that ice cream sales and drowning incidents are both high in summer. This does **not** mean eating ice cream causes drowning! A hidden factor (**lurking variable**) – the hot weather – causes both to increase.

**Always be critical and think about how the data was collected before drawing a firm conclusion.**
