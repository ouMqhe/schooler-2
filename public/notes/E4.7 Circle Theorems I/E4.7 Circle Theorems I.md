# E4.7 Circle Theorems I

## Essential Circle Theorems for Angle Calculations

### 1. Angle in a Semicircle = 90°
Any angle formed at the circumference standing on a diameter is always a right angle.

**Theorem**: If triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle with AB as diameter, then ∠ACB = 90°

**Reason**: "Angle in a semicircle is a right angle"

**Graph Reference**: angle_in_semicircle

### 2. Angle Between Tangent and Radius = 90°
The angle between a tangent and the radius drawn to the point of contact is always 90°.

**Theorem**: If OT is a radius and PT is a tangent at point T, then ∠OTP = 90°

**Reason**: "Tangent is perpendicular to radius at point of contact"

**Graph Reference**: tangent_radius_angle

### 3. Angle at Centre is Twice Angle at Circumference
An angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference.

**Theorem**: ∠AOB = 2 × ∠ACB

**Reason**: "Angle at center is twice angle at circumference"

**Graph Reference**: center_circumference_angle

### 4. Angles in Same Segment are Equal
Angles standing on the same arc (in the same segment) are equal.

**Theorem**: If points A, B, C, D lie on circumference, then ∠ACB = ∠ADB

**Reason**: "Angles in same segment are equal"

**Graph Reference**: angles_same_segment

### 5. Opposite Angles of Cyclic Quadrilateral Sum to 180°
In any cyclic quadrilateral (all vertices lie on circumference), opposite angles are supplementary.

**Theorem**: For cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, ∠A + ∠C = 180° and ∠B + ∠D = 180°

**Reason**: "Opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary"

**Graph Reference**: cyclic_quadrilateral

### 6. Alternate Segment Theorem
The angle between a tangent and a chord equals the angle in the alternate segment.

**Theorem**: If TA is tangent and AB is chord, then ∠TAB = ∠ACB

**Reason**: "Alternate segment theorem"

**Graph Reference**: alternate_segment

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Steps for Circle Theorem Problems:
1. **Identify** all given angles and marked equal lengths
2. **Locate** key features: center, radii, tangents, cyclic quadrilaterals
3. **Apply** relevant theorems systematically
4. **State** clear geometrical reasons for each step
5. **Check** that angle sums are consistent (e.g., triangle sum 180°)

### Common Diagram Patterns:
- Look for isosceles triangles formed by radii
- Identify right angles from tangents or semicircles
- Spot cyclic quadrilaterals where all vertices lie on circumference
- Recognize equal angles in the same segment

## Example Application

**Problem**: In circle with center O, AB is diameter. Point C lies on circumference such that ∠CAB = 35°. Find ∠ABC.

**Solution**:
- ∠ACB = 90° (angle in semicircle)
- ∠ABC = 180° - 90° - 35° = 55° (angle sum of triangle)

**Reasons**:
1. "Angle in semicircle is 90°"
2. "Angle sum of triangle is 180°"

## Key Points to Remember

- Always draw clear diagrams with proper labeling
- Use three-letter notation for angles (e.g., ∠ABC)
- State the exact theorem name when giving reasons
- Check if quadrilaterals are cyclic (all vertices on circle)
- Remember that radii to same circle are equal, creating isosceles triangles
- Tangent always makes 90° angle with radius at point of contact

## Examination Tips

- Write reasons clearly and precisely
- Show all working steps
- Use correct mathematical terminology
- Double-check angle calculations using different methods
- Look for multiple theorems that might apply to the same diagram

These circle theorems form a crucial part of geometric reasoning and appear frequently in examination questions. Mastery of these theorems enables solving complex angle problems involving circles.
