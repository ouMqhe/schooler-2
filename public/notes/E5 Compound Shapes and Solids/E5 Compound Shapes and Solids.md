## E5.5 Compound Shapes and Parts of Shapes

This topic tests your ability to apply the formulas from previous sections to more complex, real-world shapes. The key is to **break down** the complex figure into simpler, standard parts (like rectangles, triangles, circles, prisms, cylinders) that you know how to solve.

### 1. Perimeter and Area of Compound Shapes

A compound shape is formed by combining two or more simple shapes. They can be joined together, or one can be removed from another (e.g., a shape with a hole).

**Strategy:**
1.  **Divide** the shape into recognizable parts (squares, rectangles, triangles, sectors, etc.).
2.  Calculate the area of each individual part.
3.  **Add** the areas together if parts are joined.
4.  **Subtract** areas if a part has been removed (e.g., a hole).
5.  For **perimeter**, carefully add the lengths of all the *external sides*. Do not include the lengths of internal edges where two shapes are joined.

**Example:** Find the area of a shape made of a rectangle and a semicircle on top, where the semicircle is removed from the whole.
1.  **Divide:** This is a rectangle with a semicircle on top.
2.  **Calculate:**
    *   Area of rectangle: $A_{\text{rect}} = l \times w$
    *   Area of semicircle: $A_{\text{semi}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi r^2$
3.  **Add:** Total Area $= A_{\text{rect}} + A_{\text{semi}}$

**Example 2:** Find the area of a rectangular field with a circular pond removed.
1.  **Divide:** This is a rectangle minus a circle.
2.  **Calculate:**
    *   Area of rectangle: $A_{\text{rect}} = l \times w$
    *   Area of circle: $A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2$
3.  **Subtract:** Shaded Area $= A_{\text{rect}} - A_{\text{circle}}$

### 2. Surface Area and Volume of Compound Solids

The same principle of breaking down complex objects applies to 3D solids. A compound solid is made by joining or cutting simpler solids like cuboids, prisms, cylinders, and pyramids.

**Strategy for Volume:**
1.  Identify the simpler solids that make up the compound solid.
2.  Calculate the volume of each part using standard formulas.
3.  **Add** the volumes if parts are joined together.
4.  **Subtract** volumes if a part has been removed (e.g., a hole drilled through an object).

**Strategy for Surface Area:**
Surface area is trickier than volume because when two solids are joined, the faces at the join are no longer on the surface.
1.  Calculate the total surface area of each solid as if it were alone.
2.  **Subtract** the area of the faces that are joined together (and are therefore no longer part of the external surface).
3.  Be very careful not to forget any new internal surfaces that might be exposed if a piece is cut out.

### Parts of Solids: The Frustum

A classic example of a "part of a solid" is a **frustum** â€“ the part of a cone or pyramid that remains after the top has been cut off by a plane parallel to the base.

*Visual aid: FrustumDiagram*

While you are not expected to memorize the formula for the volume or surface area of a frustum, you must know how to calculate it by **subtracting** the smaller, removed cone from the original large cone.

**Volume of a Frustum of a Cone:**
$$ V_{\text{frustum}} = V_{\text{large cone}} - V_{\text{small cone}} $$
$$ V_{\text{frustum}} = \frac{1}{3}\pi R^2 H - \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h $$

Where $R$ is the base radius, $r$ is the top radius, $H$ is the height of the original cone, and $h$ is the height of the removed small cone. You will often need to use **similar triangles** to find the relationship between $H$, $h$, $R$, and $r$.

**Remember:** Always look for ways to decompose a complex problem into simpler, solvable steps. Check if your final answer needs to be in terms of $\pi$.
