### Time Unit Relationships

- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 day = 24 hours
- 1 week = 7 days
- 1 month = 28-31 days (use 30 days for calculations unless specified)
- 1 year = 365 days (366 in leap years)

**Example**: Convert 3.5 hours to minutes
- 3.5 × 60 = 210 minutes

**Example**: How many seconds in 2 hours 15 minutes?
- 2 hours = 2 × 3600 = 7200 seconds
- 15 minutes = 15 × 60 = 900 seconds
- Total = 7200 + 900 = 8100 seconds

## 2. 24-Hour and 12-Hour Clock Systems

### Converting Between Systems
- **12-hour to 24-hour**: Add 12 to PM hours (except 12 PM)
- **24-hour to 12-hour**: Subtract 12 from hours 13-23, add "PM"

| **12-Hour** | **24-Hour** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 12:00 AM    | 00:00       |
| 3:15 AM     | 03:15       |
| 12:00 PM    | 12:00       |
| 3:15 PM     | 15:15       |
| 11:45 PM    | 23:45       |

**Example**: Convert 18:30 to 12-hour format
- 18:30 - 12:00 = 6:30 PM

**Example**: Convert 8:45 PM to 24-hour format
- 8:45 + 12:00 = 20:45

## 3. Reading Clocks and Timetables

### Time Calculations
**Example**: A train departs at 08:45 and arrives at 12:20. What is the journey time?
- From 08:45 to 12:20 = 3 hours 35 minutes

**Example**: A flight takes 2 hours 45 minutes. If it departs at 15:30, when does it arrive?
- 15:30 + 2 hours = 17:30
- 17:30 + 45 minutes = 18:15

## 4. Time Zones and Differences

### Calculating Time Differences
**Example**: London (GMT) is 5 hours ahead of New York (EST). If it's 14:00 in London, what time is it in New York?
- 14:00 - 5 hours = 09:00

**Example**: Sydney is 10 hours ahead of London. If it's 08:00 in London, what time is it in Sydney?
- 08:00 + 10 hours = 18:00

# E1.16 Money

## 1. Calculating with Money

### Basic Money Operations
- Addition and subtraction of amounts
- Multiplication and division for multiple items
- Calculating change

**Example**: You buy items costing $3.50, $12.75, and $4.25. How much change from $25?
- Total = 3.50 + 12.75 + 4.25 = $20.50
- Change = 25.00 - 20.50 = $4.50

**Example**: 5 items cost $37.50 total. What is the cost per item?
- 37.50 ÷ 5 = $7.50 per item

## 2. Currency Conversion

### Exchange Rate Calculations
$\text{Amount in new currency} = \text{Amount in original currency} \times \text{Exchange rate}$

**Example**: Convert $150 to euros at exchange rate 1 USD = 0.85 EUR
- 150 × 0.85 = 127.50 EUR

**Example**: Convert 2000 Japanese yen to dollars at rate 1 USD = 110 JPY
- 2000 ÷ 110 ≈ $18.18

### Reverse Conversion
**Example**: You have 95 EUR. How many dollars is this at rate 1 USD = 0.85 EUR?
- 95 ÷ 0.85 ≈ $111.76

## Key Points to Remember
- When adding time, convert excess minutes to hours
- For 12-hour clock, use AM/PM correctly
- Time differences can be positive or negative depending on time zones
- Money calculations often require rounding to nearest cent
- Exchange rates can be given either way (e.g., USD to EUR or EUR to USD)
- Always specify currency units in answers

These skills are essential for travel planning, international transactions, and daily time management.
