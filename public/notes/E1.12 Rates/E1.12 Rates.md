# E1.12 Rates

## Understanding Rates
A **rate** compares two different quantities with different units. It describes how one quantity changes in relation to another.

## 1. Common Measures of Rate

### Hourly Rates of Pay
Calculating earnings based on time worked.

**Example**: If someone earns $15 per hour and works 37.5 hours:
- Earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked
- Earnings = $15 × 37.5 = $562.50

### Exchange Rates
Converting between different currencies.

**Example**: If the exchange rate is 1 USD = 0.85 EUR:
- Convert $200 to euros: 200 × 0.85 = 170 EUR
- Convert 340 EUR to dollars: 340 ÷ 0.85 = $400

### Flow Rates
Measuring volume of liquid passing through a point per unit time.

**Example**: A pipe has a flow rate of 120 liters per minute.
- Flow in 45 minutes: 120 × 45 = 5400 liters
- Time to fill 1800L tank: 1800 ÷ 120 = 15 minutes

### Fuel Consumption
Measuring distance traveled per unit of fuel.

**Example**: A car consumes 7.2 liters per 100km.
- Fuel used for 350km: (7.2 ÷ 100) × 350 = 25.2 liters
- Distance possible with 45L: (100 ÷ 7.2) × 45 ≈ 625km

## 2. Other Measures of Rate

### Pressure
Force applied per unit area: $\text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}}$

**Example**: A force of 500N acts on an area of 2.5m²:
- Pressure = 500 ÷ 2.5 = 200 N/m²

### Density
Mass per unit volume: $\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}$

**Example**: An object has mass 240g and volume 80cm³:
- Density = 240 ÷ 80 = 3 g/cm³

### Population Density
People per unit area: $\text{Population Density} = \frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Area}}$

**Example**: A city of 840,000 people covers 350km²:
- Population density = 840,000 ÷ 350 = 2400 people/km²

## 3. Average Speed Problems

### Speed Formula
$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}$

**Example**: A cyclist travels 45km in 3 hours 45 minutes
- Convert time to hours: 3 hours + (45 ÷ 60) = 3.75 hours
- Average speed = 45 ÷ 3.75 = 12 km/h

### Unit Conversions
Common speed units include:
- km/h (kilometers per hour)
- m/s (meters per second)
- mph (miles per hour)

**Example**: Convert 72 km/h to m/s
- 72 km/h = 72,000 m/3,600 s = 20 m/s

## Key Points to Remember
- Always include units in rate calculations
- Convert all measurements to consistent units before calculating
- For average speed, use total distance and total time
- Rate problems often involve proportional reasoning
- Common rate formulas will be provided in exam questions

Understanding rates is essential for solving real-world problems involving speed, consumption, density, and financial calculations.
