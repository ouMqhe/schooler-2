# E4.6 Angles

## 1. Calculate Unknown Angles Using Basic Geometrical Properties

### Fundamental Angle Properties:
- **Sum of angles at a point** = $360^\circ$
- **Sum of angles on a straight line** = $180^\circ$
- **Vertically opposite angles** are equal
- **Angle sum of a triangle** = $180^\circ$
- **Angle sum of a quadrilateral** = $360^\circ$

## 2. Angles Formed with Parallel Lines

When a transversal crosses parallel lines:

### Key Relationships:
- **Corresponding angles** are equal
- **Alternate angles** are equal
- **Co-interior angles** sum to $180^\circ$ (supplementary)

**Three-letter notation** is used to identify angles (e.g., angle ABC)

## 3. Angle Properties of Polygons

### Regular Polygons:
- All interior angles equal
- All exterior angles equal
- **Interior angle** = $\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}$
- **Exterior angle** = $\frac{360^\circ}{n}$
- **Sum of interior angles** = $(n-2) \times 180^\circ$
- **Sum of exterior angles** = $360^\circ$

### Irregular Polygons:
- Angles not necessarily equal
- Same angle sum formulas apply

## Key Terminology and Notation

### Three-Letter Angle Notation:
- Angle ABC: Angle with vertex B, formed by points A-B-C
- Always name angles with vertex as the middle letter

### Geometrical Terminology for Reasoning:
- "Angles on a straight line sum to 180°"
- "Vertically opposite angles are equal"
- "Corresponding angles are equal (F shape)"
- "Alternate angles are equal (Z shape)"
- "Co-interior angles sum to 180° (C shape)"

## Problem-Solving Approach

### Steps for Angle Problems:
1. Identify known angles and relationships
2. Apply appropriate angle properties
3. Use three-letter notation to specify angles
4. Provide clear geometrical reasons for each step
5. Check that angle sums are consistent

### Common Applications:
- Finding missing angles in complex diagrams
- Proving geometrical relationships
- Solving problems with multiple parallel lines
- Working with polygons of various types

## Important Notes

- Always use correct mathematical terminology when giving reasons
- Three-letter notation prevents ambiguity in angle identification
- Understanding these properties is essential for more advanced geometry
- Regular polygons have predictable angle properties
- The sum of exterior angles is always 360° for any convex polygon

These angle properties form the foundation of geometrical reasoning and are frequently tested in examination questions.
