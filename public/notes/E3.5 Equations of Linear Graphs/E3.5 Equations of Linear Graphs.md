# E3.5 Equations of Linear Graphs

## Interpret and Obtain the Equation of a Straight-Line Graph

Linear equations can be expressed in several forms, and you should be able to work with each of them:

### Common Forms of Linear Equations
- **Standard form**: $ ax + by = c $
- **Slope-intercept form**: $ y = mx + c $
- **Vertical line**: $ x = k $
- **Horizontal line**: $ y = c $

## Finding Equations from Graphs

When given a straight-line graph, you can determine its equation by:
1. Identifying two points on the line
2. Calculating the gradient: $ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $
3. Finding the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)
4. Writing the equation in the required form

## Finding Gradient and Y-Intercept from Equations

### From Slope-Intercept Form ($ y = mx + c $)
- Gradient = m (coefficient of x)
- Y-intercept = c (constant term)

### From Standard Form ($ ax + by = c $)
Convert to slope-intercept form:
1. Isolate y: $ by = -ax + c $
2. Divide by b: $ y = -\frac{a}{b}x + \frac{c}{b} $
3. Gradient = $ -\frac{a}{b} $
4. Y-intercept = $ \frac{c}{b} $

**Example**: Find the gradient and y-intercept of $ 5x + 4y = 8 $
- Rearrange: $ 4y = -5x + 8 $
- Divide by 4: $ y = -\frac{5}{4}x + 2 $
- Gradient = $ -\frac{5}{4} $
- Y-intercept = 2

## Special Cases

### Vertical Lines
- Equation: $ x = k $ (where k is a constant)
- Undefined gradient
- No y-intercept (unless k = 0)

### Horizontal Lines
- Equation: $ y = c $ (where c is a constant)
- Gradient = 0
- Y-intercept = c

## Simplification Requirements

Equations must be given in fully simplified form:
- No fractions in the final answer (unless specified)
- No common factors in coefficients
- Proper ordering of terms

**Example**: Simplify $ 2y = 6x + 8 $
- Divide all terms by 2: $ y = 3x + 4 $

**Example**: Simplify $ 4x + 8y = 12 $
- Divide all terms by 4: $ x + 2y = 3 $

## Key Skills
- Convert between different forms of linear equations
- Extract gradient and intercept information from equations
- Write equations from graphical information
- Recognize special cases (vertical and horizontal lines)
- Simplify equations to their most basic form

## Common Problem Types
1. "Find the equation of this line" (given a graph)
2. "Write the equation in the form ax + by = c"
3. "What is the gradient and y-intercept of this line?"
4. "Does this point lie on the line with equation...?"
5. "Find the equation of a line parallel/perpendicular to..."

Mastering these skills is essential for coordinate geometry and will be used extensively in more advanced mathematics topics.
