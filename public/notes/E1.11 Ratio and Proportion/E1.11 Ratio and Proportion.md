# E1.11 Ratio and Proportion

## Understanding Ratio and Proportion

A **ratio** compares two or more quantities of the same kind, showing their relative sizes. A **proportion** is an equation stating that two ratios are equal.

## 1. Ratios in Simplest Form

To express a ratio in its simplest form, divide all terms by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Example**: Simplify 20:30:40
- GCD of 20, 30, and 40 is 10
- Divide each term by 10: 2:3:4
- Simplest form: 2:3:4

## 2. Dividing a Quantity in a Given Ratio

To divide a quantity according to a ratio:
1. Add the parts of the ratio to find the total number of parts
2. Divide the quantity by the total number of parts to find the value of one part
3. Multiply each ratio term by the value of one part

**Example**: Divide $120 in the ratio 3:2:1
- Total parts: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 parts
- Value of one part: $120 ÷ 6 = $20
- Division: 3 × $20 = $60, 2 × $20 = $40, 1 × $20 = $20
- Result: $60:$40:$20

## 3. Proportional Reasoning in Context

### Recipe Adaptation
When scaling recipes, maintain the proportion between ingredients.



**Example**: A recipe for 4 people requires 200g flour and 100g sugar. How much for 6 people?

- Ratio: 4 people : 6 people = 2:3
- Multiply ingredients by $\frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}$
- Flour: 200g × $\frac{3}{2}$ = 300g
- Sugar: 1020g × $\frac{3}{2}$ = 150g



### Map Scales
Map scales represent real-world distances in reduced proportion.

**Example**: A map scale is 1:50,000. If two towns are 8cm apart on the map, what is the actual distance?
- Actual distance = Map distance × Scale denominator
- 8cm × 50,000 = 400,000cm = 4km

### Determining Best Value
Compare unit prices to determine the best value when shopping.

**Example**: Which is better value?
- Option A: 500g for $4.50 → $\frac{4.50}{500} = 0.009$/g
- Option B: 750g for $6.30 → $\frac{6.30}{750} = 0.0084$/g
- Option B has lower cost per gram, so better value

## Key Points to Remember
- Always simplify ratios to their lowest terms
- When dividing quantities, ensure the sum of the parts equals the whole
- In proportional reasoning, maintain the same relationship between quantities
- Unit pricing helps compare value across different package sizes

Understanding ratios and proportions is essential for solving real-world problems involving comparisons, scaling, and value assessment.
