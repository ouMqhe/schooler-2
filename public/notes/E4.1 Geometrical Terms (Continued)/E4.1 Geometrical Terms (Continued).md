# E4.1 Geometrical Terms (Continued)

## Polygons

### Regular and Irregular Polygons
- **Regular Polygon**: All sides and angles are equal (e.g., equilateral triangle, square)
- **Irregular Polygon**: Sides and/or angles are not all equal

### Specific Polygons
- **Pentagon**: 5-sided polygon
- **Hexagon**: 6-sided polygon  
- **Octagon**: 8-sided polygon
- **Decagon**: 10-sided polygon

## Solids

### Common 3D Shapes
- **Cube**: Regular solid with 6 square faces
- **Cuboid**: Rectangular solid (like a box)
- **Prism**: Solid with identical parallel ends and rectangular sides
- **Cylinder**: Solid with circular parallel ends and curved surface
- **Pyramid**: Solid with polygonal base and triangular faces meeting at apex
- **Cone**: Solid with circular base and curved surface tapering to point
- **Sphere**: Perfectly round solid (ball shape)
- **Hemisphere**: Half of a sphere
- **Frustum**: Pyramid or cone with top cut off parallel to base

### Parts of Solids
- **Face**: Flat surface of a solid
- **Surface**: Outer boundary (can be flat or curved)
- **Edge**: Line where two faces meet

## Circle Vocabulary

### Essential Circle Terms
- **Centre**: Middle point, equidistant from all points on circumference
- **Radius** (plural radii): Distance from centre to circumference
- **Diameter**: Distance across circle through centre (2 × radius)
- **Circumference**: Perimeter/distance around the circle
- **Semicircle**: Half of a circle

### Lines and Parts
- **Chord**: Straight line connecting two points on circumference
- **Tangent**: Straight line touching circle at exactly one point
- **Arc**: Part of circumference
  - **Major Arc**: Larger arc between two points
  - **Minor Arc**: Smaller arc between two points
- **Sector**: Region bounded by two radii and an arc (like pizza slice)
- **Segment**: Region bounded by chord and arc

**Graph Reference**: circle_parts_demo

## Key Relationships

### Circle Formulas
- Circumference = π × diameter = 2 × π × radius
- Area = π × radius²
- Length of arc = (θ/360) × 2πr (where θ is angle in degrees)
- Area of sector = (θ/360) × πr²

### Regular Polygon Properties
- Interior angle = [(n-2) × 180°]/n (where n = number of sides)
- Exterior angle = 360°/n
- Sum of interior angles = (n-2) × 180°

## Important Notes

- All radii of a circle are equal
- Diameter is the longest chord in a circle
- A tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact
- Regular polygons can be inscribed in circles (all vertices lie on circumference)
- Understanding these terms is essential for solving geometry problems involving circles and solids
