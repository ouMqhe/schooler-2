# E2.6 Inequalities

## 1. Representing and Interpreting Inequalities on a Number Line

Inequalities show the relationship between expressions that are not equal. They can be represented visually on a number line.

### Notation Conventions
- **Open circles** ◦ for strict inequalities: <, >
- **Closed circles** • for inclusive inequalities: ≤, ≥

**Example**: Represent \(-3 \leq x < 1\) on a number line
