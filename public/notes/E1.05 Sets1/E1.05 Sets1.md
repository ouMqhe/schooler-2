# Set Theory Essentials

## Set Notation & Language

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, called **elements**.

**Notation**:
- Curly braces denote a set: $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$
- $n(A)$: Number of elements in set A (e.g., $n(A) = 4$)
- $\varepsilon$: Universal set (all elements under consideration)
- $A'$: Complement of set A (elements not in A but in $\varepsilon$)

## Set Definitions

Sets can be defined by:
- **Listing elements**: $B = \{a, b, c\}$
- **Describing properties**: $A = \{x: x \text{ is a natural number}\}$
- **Using inequalities**: $C = \{x: a < x < b\}$

## Venn Diagrams

Visual representations showing relationships between sets. Limited to **two sets** in this course.

## Key Operations

**Union ($A \cup B$)**: All elements in A **or** B or both

**Intersection ($A \cap B$)**: Elements common to **both** A and B

## Practical Example

Let:
- $\varepsilon = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$
- $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$
- $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$

Then:
- $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- $A \cap B = \{3, 4\}$
- $A' = \{5, 6, 7, 8\}$
- $n(A) = 4$


Venn diagrams help visualize these relationships and solve problems involving set counts.
