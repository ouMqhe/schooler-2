## E7.1 Transformations

A transformation changes the position, size, or orientation of a shape. The original shape is called the **object**, and the transformed shape is called the **image**.

### 1. Reflection

A reflection is a **flip** of a shape over a mirror line. The mirror line is called the **line of reflection**.

**Properties:**
- The object and its image are **congruent** (same shape and size).
- Each point on the image is the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line as the corresponding point on the object.
- The line joining a point to its image is **perpendicular** to the mirror line.

**How to reflect a shape:**
1.  For each vertex (corner) of the object, measure its perpendicular distance to the mirror line.
2.  Plot the image vertex the same distance on the opposite side of the line.
3.  Join the image vertices together.

### 2. Rotation

A rotation is a **turn** of a shape around a fixed point called the **centre of rotation**. You need to know the angle and direction of the rotation (e.g., $90^\circ$ clockwise, $180^\circ$, $90^\circ$ anticlockwise).

**Properties:**
- The object and its image are **congruent**.
- The distance from the centre of rotation to any point on the object is the same as the distance to the corresponding point on the image.

**How to rotate a shape:**
1.  For each vertex, draw a line from the centre of rotation to the vertex.
2.  Use a protractor to measure the required angle from this line.
3.  Measure the distance from the centre to the vertex and mark the image vertex at this same distance along the new line.
4.  Join the image vertices together.

### 3. Enlargement

An enlargement changes the size of a shape. It is defined by a **centre of enlargement** and a **scale factor**.

**Properties:**
- The object and its image are **similar** (same shape, but size changed proportionally).
- The scale factor ($k$) determines the size change:
  - If $|k| > 1$, the image is larger than the object.
  - If $|k| < 1$, the image is smaller than the object (a reduction).
  - If $k$ is **negative**, the image is on the opposite side of the centre of enlargement and is inverted.

**How to enlarge a shape:**
1.  Draw a line from the centre of enlargement through each vertex of the object.
2.  If the scale factor is $k$, the distance from the centre to an image vertex is $k$ times the distance from the centre to the corresponding object vertex.
    $$ \text{Distance}_{(\text{centre to image})} = k \times \text{Distance}_{(\text{centre to object})} $$
3.  Plot the image vertices and join them.

### 4. Translation

A translation is a **slide** of a shape. Every point in the shape moves the same distance in the same direction. A translation is defined by a **vector** $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$.

**Properties:**
- The object and its image are **congruent**.
- The orientation of the shape does not change.

**How to translate a shape:**
1.  For each vertex of the object, move it $x$ units horizontally and $y$ units vertically.
2.  Plot the new points and join them.

**Combined Transformations:** A question may ask you to perform one transformation and then another on the image. Describe the **single transformation** that would map the original object directly to the final image.

## E7.2 Vectors in Two Dimensions

A vector has both **magnitude** (size) and **direction**. It is not a fixed position in space.

### 1. Describing Vectors

Vectors can be represented in several ways:
- **Column Vector:** $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$
  - $x$ is the horizontal component (right/left).
  - $y$ is the vertical component (up/down).
- **Directed Line Segment:** $\overrightarrow{AB}$ represents the vector from point $A$ to point $B$.
- **Bold Lowercase Letter:** **a**

**Example:** The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}$ means 3 units to the right and 2 units down.

### 2. Adding and Subtracting Vectors

Vectors are added and subtracted by combining their corresponding components.

**Addition:**
$$ \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a + c \\ b + d \end{pmatrix} $$

**Subtraction:**
$$ \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a - c \\ b - d \end{pmatrix} $$

**Geometrically,** adding vectors $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ means following vector $\mathbf{a}$ and then vector $\mathbf{b}$ from where $\mathbf{a}$ finished. The sum is the direct route from the start to the finish.

### 3. Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar

A **scalar** is a number with magnitude but no direction (e.g., 2, -1, $\frac{1}{2}$). Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude and possibly its direction.

**Rule:** Multiply each component of the vector by the scalar.
$$ k \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} kx \\ ky \end{pmatrix} $$

**Effects:**
- If $k > 0$, the direction is unchanged, but the length is scaled by $k$.
- If $k < 0$, the direction is reversed, and the length is scaled by $|k|$.
- If $k = 0$, the result is the zero vector $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.

**Example:**
$$ 3 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} $$
$$ -2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ -8 \end{pmatrix} $$
