# E5: Units, Area, and Perimeter

## E5.1 Units of Measure

Using the correct units and converting between them is a fundamental skill. We use the metric system, which is based on powers of ten.

### Common Units

*   **Length:** millimetre (mm), centimetre (cm), metre (m), kilometre (km)
*   **Area:** square millimetre (mm²), square centimetre (cm²), square metre (m²), square kilometre (km²)
*   **Volume:** cubic millimetre (mm³), cubic centimetre (cm³), cubic metre (m³)
*   **Capacity:** millilitre (ml), litre (l)
*   **Mass:** gram (g), kilogram (kg)

A key relationship to remember is that **1 cm³ = 1 ml**. This connects volume and capacity.

### Conversion Factors

You must know how to convert between units. Remember that converting between units of area and volume is different from length.

**Length:**
$$ 1 \text{ cm} = 10 \text{ mm} $$
$$ 1 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ cm} $$
$$ 1 \text{ km} = 1000 \text{ m} $$

**Area:** Since area is length × length, the conversion factor is squared.
$$ 1 \text{ cm}^2 = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ mm}^2 $$
$$ 1 \text{ m}^2 = 100 \times 100 = 10,000 \text{ cm}^2 $$
$$ 1 \text{ km}^2 = 1000 \times 1000 = 1,000,000 \text{ m}^2 $$

**Volume:** Volume is length × length × length, so the conversion factor is cubed.
$$ 1 \text{ cm}^3 = 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000 \text{ mm}^3 $$
$$ 1 \text{ m}^3 = 100 \times 100 \times 100 = 1,000,000 \text{ cm}^3 $$

**Volume to Capacity:**
$$ 1 \text{ litre (l)} = 1000 \text{ ml} $$
$$ 1 \text{ ml} = 1 \text{ cm}^3 $$
$$ 1 \text{ m}^3 = 1000 \text{ litres (l)} $$

**Example Conversion:** Convert 5.2 m² to cm².
Since $1 \text{ m}^2 = 10,000 \text{ cm}^2$, we multiply:
$$ 5.2 \text{ m}^2 = 5.2 \times 10,000 = 52,000 \text{ cm}^2 $$

## E5.2 Area and Perimeter

Formulas for the perimeter and area of common shapes are essential. **Except for the area of a triangle, these formulas are NOT given in the exam and must be memorized.**

### Rectangle

*   **Perimeter:** $P = 2(l + w)$ or $P = 2l + 2w$
    where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width.
*   **Area:** $A = l \times w$

### Triangle

*   **Perimeter:** $P = a + b + c$
    where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the three sides.
*   **Area:** $A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$
    where $b$ is the base length and $h$ is the perpendicular height. **This formula is given to you.**

### Parallelogram

*   **Perimeter:** $P = 2(a + b)$
    where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of two adjacent sides.
*   **Area:** $A = b \times h$
    where $b$ is the base length and $h$ is the perpendicular height. *Note: The slanted side is not the height.*

### Trapezium (Trapezoid)

A trapezium has one pair of parallel sides.
*   **Perimeter:** $P = a + b + c + d$
    where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the lengths of the four sides.
*   **Area:** $A = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h$
    where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and $h$ is the perpendicular height between them.

*Visual aid: TrapeziumDiagram*

**Example Problem:** A trapezium has parallel sides of 8 cm and 5 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is its area?
$$ A = \frac{1}{2} \times (8 + 5) \times 4 $$
$$ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 \times 4 $$
$$ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 52 $$
$$ A = 26 \text{ cm}^2 $$

Always remember to include the correct units in your final answer (e.g., cm, m², cm³).
